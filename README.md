## Overview
Aqueduct is a SMS-based chatbot designed to bring internet access to areas with little or no internet infrastructure. The service is primarily aimed at users of feature phones.

This idea is an entry to NWHACKS2020.

## The Problem
Many people around the world have access to SMS but are exposed to little or no internet access. Furthermore, in certain countries the Internet is heavily censored.
The Goal of Aqueduct is to serve as the "aqueduct" of internet access to those who do not have the privilege.

## The Solution
Using Twilio, Web scraping and API's we've designed a client that allows for access to popular website data send to the user through a simple SMS
with this, thus providing a gateway for internet access through an unconventional mean.
